Cute invaders it's an Html5 game inspired by the classic arcade game [Space Invaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders).
It has 13 levels with increased difficulty.  (=^･^=) Can you finish them all? 

I've always been a video game lover and with this project I had the opportunity to create one. 
I learned a lot about game mechanics, physics engine and game states. It was an awesome experience   

Cute Invaders is written in Javascript. It relies on [Phaser 2](http://phaser.io/) game framework as the game engine.

The art, assets and sprite sheets has been created in [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) 
and provided by [Rubi Villanueva](https://github.com/rubivg).

Happy playing!!! ღゝ◡╹)ノ♡
